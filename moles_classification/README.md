In this example, I try to classify skin moles using a dataset provided by http://www.fc.up.pt/addi/ph2%20database.html

Even if the number of features is not high, I put some focus on visualizing the features to understand their importance. 
In some cases, it may be useful to delete some of them to improve the accuracy. 
Finally, I tried four different ML algorithms to test the solution.
