I wrote this code following the chapter 3 of book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow" by Aurelien Geron.

I wrote in the comments only the highlights; for a complete understanding of the concepts I highly recommend the book:
[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646)
