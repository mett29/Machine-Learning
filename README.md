# Machine-Learning
In this repository I'm going to upload all the exercises which I'll do to learn machine learning.

***Machine learning** is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" (e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.*  [[WIKIPEDIA]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

There are two types of machine learning algorithms:

### Supervised learning
Let's say you have to estimate an house price in a specific area based on its **features**, like size, number of rooms ecc.
What you have is a list of all houses in that area (often a csv file) with the relevant information (features).
In this file, for each house you also have one special feature: the label, i.e. the house price, that is what you want to estimate for the new house.
So the ML algorithm you apply learns from all these features and goes backward to figure out the logic and eventually output a value (in this case).

### Unsupervised learning
This is more difficult, because you have no labels, i.e. you don't know the house prices in that area, so the algorithm can't learn, because it has no answers.
That's why there are other algorithms, which use different techniques to do the same job. One example is the **clustering method**, which tries to find a pattern in the data you provide, simply "looking" at them.
