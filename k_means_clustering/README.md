# K-means clustering

k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. 
K-means clustering aims to partition **n** observations into **k** clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells.

It's a type of **unsupervised learning algorithm**.
The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of the groups based on the features that are provided. Data points are clustered based on feature similarity.
